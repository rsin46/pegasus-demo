It is also our position, however, given the strong evidence for its potential violability, that inquiry into its status should not be stifled by certain unscientific attitudes and practices that have operated thus far. This volume should be of interest to researchers in any field to which the second law pertains, especially to physicists, chemists and engineers involved with thermodynamics and statistical physics. Chapter 3, which develops quantum mechanical formalism, should interest historians and philosophers of science.
