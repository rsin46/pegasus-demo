Now, early in the 21st, another shift appears imminent, this one involving the second law of thermodynamics.

In July 2002, the first conference on its status was convened By the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, a rapid succession of theoretical quantum mechanical challenges were being advanced by C  ⁇ apek, et al., Allahverdyan, Nieuwenhuizen, et al., classical challenges by Liboff, Crosignani and Di Porto, as well as more This volume should be of interest to researchers in any field to which the second law pertains, especially to physicists, chemists and engineers involved with thermodynamics and statistical physics.

Chapter 1: Entropy and the Second Law 3 In equilibrium thermodynamics, the first law is written in terms of an additive state function, the internal energy U, whose exact differential dU fulfills dU =  ⁇ Q +  ⁇ W. (In nonequilibrium thermodynamics, there are problems with introducing these quantities The second most cited version, and perhaps the most natural and experientially obvious, is due to Clausius (1854) [4]: (2) Clausius-Heat No process is possible for which the sole effect is that heat flows from a reservoir at a given temperature to a reservoir at higher temperature. The primary result of Carnot Since absolute zero (Tc = 0) is unattainable (by one version of the third law) and since Th =  ⁇  for any realistic system, the Carnot efficiency forbids perfect conversion of heat into work (i.e.,  ⁇  = 1).

Koenig also offers the following orphan version [9]: (11) Free Expansion Adiabatic free expansion of a perfect gas is an irreversible process. A related statement is given by Gyftopolous and Beretta [19]: (14) Gyftopolous and Beretta Among all the states of a system with given values of energy, the amounts of constituents and the parameters, there is one and only one stable equilibrium state. Moreover, starting from any state of a system it is Naturally, the first comes from Clausius: (15) Clausius-Entropy [4, 6] For an adiabatically isolated system that undergoes a change from one equilibrium state to another, if the thermodynamic process is reversible, then the entropy change is zero; if the process is irreversible, the entropy change is positive Gibbs takes a different tack to the second law by avoiding thermodynamic processes, and instead conjoins entropy with equilibrium [25, 6]: (17) Gibbs For the equilibrium of an isolated system, it is necessary and sufficient that in all possible variations of the state of the system which do not alter its energy, the variation of its entropy In fact, mathematicians have labored to drain this “dismal swamp of obscurity” [28], beginning with Carath  ⁇ eodory [30] and culminating with the recent tour de force by Lieb and Yngvason [31].

First, the While this assumption is natural when temperature is well defined, once finite coupling of the system to a bath is introduced, this assumption can be violated appreciably, especially for systems which purport second law violation (e.g., [36]). (Clausius) • Murphy’s Law (and corollary Although our conceptions of energy, entropy and the universe have undergone tremendous change since his time, remarkably, Clausius’ summary still rings true today — and perhaps even more so now for having weathered so much.

Entropy is a global property of a system, measurable in terms of the surface area of the constant energy manifold on which the system’s phase space point wanders, but this assumes conditions on the motion of the phase If entropy is defined at the microscopic level of detail necessary to make completely accurate predictions about phase space trajectories, however, it loses its utility — and meaning 20. 19A few simple cases, like the ideal gas, will be predictable due to their thermodynamic simplicity, but realistically complex nonequilibrium systems that possess significant thermodynamic depth — Scully maintains, “The third law has all the weight of an Italian traffic advisory.” Chapter 1: Entropy and the Second Law 29 number of microstates that describes this perfect substance at T = 0 is  ⁇  = 1, then its entropy via the Boltzmann formula is S = k ln[ ⁇  = 1 The third law can also be stated as impossibilities, for instance: It is impossible to reduce the temperature of a system to absolute zero via any finite sequence of steps.

As remarked by Fermi [22] and echoed by others, “support for this law consists mainly in the failure of all efforts that have been made to construct a perpetuum mobile of the second kind.” Certainly its empirical support is vast and presently uncracked; however, one must be careful not to fall prey to Zermello argued, based on Poincar  ⁇ e’s recurrence cycles, that systems should display quasiperiodicity; that is, a system’s trajectory in 6N-dimensional phase space should eventually pass arbitrarily close to previously visited points, which can represent lower entropy states, in which case the system will For macroscopic systems, the number of complexions at equilibrium is so much greater than the number even slightly away from equilibrium that nonequilibrium states are effectively never seen once equilibrium is achieved. 44 Challenges to the Second Law 2.3.2 Modern Classical Arguments Perhaps the best known modern arguments in theoretical support of the second law are those (At this point ln( ⁇ ) has not been identified with entropy.)

Integration of the local f(v) or phase space diagrams, particularly to obtain velocity moments, allows one to assess local and global thermodynamic quantities such as number density, particle flux, pressure, kinetic energy density, and entropy density.

Three types of serial contours are apparent: i) open, slanted, roughly linear and parallel, high-velocity, low phase space density contours (2.5% - 30%); ii) slanted, nested chevron contours of medium- to high-velocity and high density (40% - 100%); and iii) nested finger-shaped loops with is almost the inverse velocity of S2 inflow (Q-III), but with two differences: (1) Q-IV’s intermediate contours (40% - 60%) are less pronounced than in Q-III, indicating fewer medium velocity atoms; while (2) extra atoms appear in Q-IV as high-velocity tail particles, Conversely, at high gravitator mass the gas is strongly bound to the gravitator and does not cycle to the walls, while at low mass the gas surface collisions are effectively thermal (rather than suprathermal); i.e., they are symmetric for S1 and S2.

For systems similar to the present laboratory experiments thermal or plasma degradation could be minor since the vapor pressures of the refractory metals (Ta, Mo) are small, since their chemical reactivity with alkali metals (K, Cs) are negligible, and since the electron and ion energies (0.2 eV) are too small to 9 MEMS/NEMS Devices Two challenges are discussed that involve room-temperature, micro- and nanoscopic semiconductor structures and utilize the thermally-sustained electric fields of p-n junctions. 9.1 Introduction This chapter is concerned with two experimentally-testable solid-state second law challenges that can operate at room temperature and which These solid state challenges, on the other hand, make positive claims on both, for, whereas previous challenges are viable only under extreme thermodynamic conditions (e.g., high temperatures (T  ⁇  1000K), low temperatures (T  ⁇  100K), or low pressure (P  ⁇  1 Torr)), Standard one-dimensional formulae have been used to estimate Vbi and xdr [7, 8]: 270 Challenges to the Second Law Vbi = kT q ln(NAND n2 i ) (9.1) and xdr = 2 ⁇ oVbi q (NA + ND) NAND 1 2 (9.2 Since the electric field in the J-I depletion region is unidirectional, there must be a second electric field somewhere else along the loop to satisfy Faraday’s law ( E  ⁇  dl = 0).

Since the total charge in the standard device’s J-II region is found to be Qtotal 330q, one expects less than one percent statistical fluctuation in electronic charge over the entire J-II channel capacitor during a piston’s oscillation period. To put this in perspective, one cubic meter of standard devices (amounting to 1018 in number) could, in principle, convert thermal energy into work with instantaneous power output on par with the output of a modern-day nuclear power plant; or, in 1 second, produce the work equivalent of the explosive yield of For mechanical Q  ⁇  103, and for matched electrical 292 Challenges to the Second Law and mechanical time constants ( ⁇ e  ⁇   ⁇ m), the system can execute steady-state, resonant oscillation by which thermal energy is converted into mechanical energy.

Looking from another angle, if the second law is taken as a fundamental assumption, then the invariance of phase volume may be considered as a constraint imposed by the second law on the allowable dynamics of the mechanical systems. It is estimated that since the emergence of life on Earth roughly 3.8 - 4 billion years ago, on Since there are several imaginable scenarios in which thermosynthetic life (TL) [15] would compete well with or even outcompete ordinary free-energy life (FEL) by subverting the second law, it is reasonable to seek biological violation. Multicellular life is less likely to exploit thermal energy than unicellular life because it (In recent years it has become apparent that deep-rock microbes enjoy significant diversity and might actually represent greater biomass than surface dwelling life [17].) These environments can also be quite stable so as to allow TL to evolve and thrive without direct competition from FEL for long periods of time. In summary, if thermosynthetic (At present, three domains are generally recognized: eukaryotes (cells with nuclei), bacteria and archaea (cells without nuclei); the latter two display superthermophilicity.)

An electronic charge falling through this potential would have roughly the energy required to drive typical chemical reactions: qVm =  ⁇ E  ⁇  0.5 ⁇ 4eV.

Quantum transitions that require large and specific energies cannot be triggered prematurely (i.e., by thermal energy steps); furthermore, the reactions can be triggered and mediated by structure dependencies, for instance, those that might occur only at the membrane boundaries. Electrons falling down the conducting ladder to the reaction center in Figure 10.1 could In other words, reactants would be tightly bound on the reaction template until a high energy electron falls through the membrane potential and drives the reaction forward, at which time the product is loosely bound and, therefore, quickly desorbs and diffuses away, thereby supressing the reverse reaction. The reactants, coupled with Based on the availability of free energy sources and nutrients and on the amount of carbon dioxide produced from the oxidation of organic matter, it is estimated that many deep rock microbes have metabolisms that are more than a billion times slower than surface free-energy microbes, thereby possibly putting them below TL in energy utilization.

In summary, given the exigencies of natural selection and the plausibility of second law Future projections are almost certainly seriously off the mark (if not entirely wrong) — just as are ancient myths, considered in the light of modern science — since even the most basic escatological questions have no definitive answers. Nonetheless, as pointed out by Dyson [35], the value of eschatology may not lie so If the last 100 years are any indication of the dominance humans can wield over their home planet, then extrapolating this last 10 ⁇ 7 fraction of Earth’s history out to cosmological time scales, one cannot rule out the possibility that intelligent action — though almost certainly not genetically human and, hopefully, more than humanly wise In the latter half of the 19th and through the early 20th centuries, before cosmological expansion was discovered, the general sentiment surrounding heat death was perhaps most famously expressed by Bertrand Russell [54]: All the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius are That it does not immediately achieve something akin to thermal equilibrium — for instance, during the recombination era (z  ⁇  1500) when it moved from a fairly spatially uniform plasma state to a neutral atom state — is due primarily to the gravitational clumping and, to a lesser degree, to the cosmic expansion itself which continually creates In the far future, the march toward equilibrium will step to a different beat: rather than being set by nuclear fusion, it will be set mainly by proton decay, black hole and positronium formation and evaporation.
