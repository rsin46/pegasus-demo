In 2004, the second edition of Leff’s and Rex’s classic anthology on Maxwell’s second law of thermodynamics [2], further raising interest in the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics was first proposed by Leff’s and Rex’s classic anthology on Maxwell’s second

(Appendix I) • Perpetual motion is well defined, especially when the original forms of the second law (Kelvin and Clausius) are strictly nonequilibrium in character and most second law challenges are inherently nonequilibrium in character.

The idea of the weak-coupling regime goes back to van Hove [13] and consists of several steps: • The Hamiltonian of the (system + bath) complex is written as a sum of those of the system only HS, the bath only HB, and the system-bath coupling HS ?? In [22], it

The Davies statement (3.50) means that (3.53) or (3.33) can be validly applied, for any finite strength of the coupling, only for finite time intervals limited from above (t ?? 2, (3.56) would yield infinitely slower particle transfer, i.e., dephasing, than using

In order to understand the effects of the system-bath coupling, one should realize that the relaxation in the state of the central system (3.90) can be taken as the opposite relation to the state of the particles (3.90). In order to understand the effects of the system-bath coupling, one should realize that the

Although Pippard raised questions about 120 Challenges to the Second Law the irreversible effects in the magnetization cycle of superconducting colloids as early as 1952 [15], up to now there has been little experimental work devoted to the magnetization and transition between normal and superconducting states of small samples of Type-I superconductors.

(In this paper, suprathermal refers to particles with average speeds greater than the thermal speed, up to several times the thermal speed.) Briefly, the paradoxical system consists of a blackbody cavity housing a gravitator of comparable dimensions and a tenuous gas Figure 6.1. The gas in the 178 Challenges to the

(Here, however, the situation is complicated by two caveats: a) the atmosphere is distended beyond the radius of space curvature of the planet; and b) the cavity walls act as an additional boundary condition.) Velocity integration gives a roughly exponential decay of particle number density with radius.

The Loschmidt effect has been shown to be independent of the temperature of the gas column, but it is not clear whether the Loschmidt effect is independent of the temperature of the gas column, or whether the Loschmidt effect is independent of the temperature of the gas column..

In the experiments to follow, it will be shown that, using purely thermal plasma generation, a non-thermal thermocouple element was buried between the cavity wall and the thermocouple at the midpoint of the cavity temperature range (point A) and the thermocouple at the center of the cavity temperature range (point B) were measured simultaneously with
